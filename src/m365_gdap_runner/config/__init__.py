"""Configuration and secrets for m365_gdap_runner.

Public API::

    from m365_gdap_runner.config import Settings, load_settings

    settings = load_settings(profile="contoso")
    settings.api_url

Non-secret values live in a per-user ``config.toml`` (see ``paths.py`` for
the OS-specific location); secrets live in whichever credential backend the
user selects (``credential_backend`` in config.toml) and are never written
to the file. The config CLI creates and edits the file; no hand-editing is
required.

Module map (each module's docstring carries its own removal instructions
where applicable):

- ``schema.py``  — the ``Settings`` dataclass: single source of truth for
  option names, types, defaults, secret classification, and help text.
- ``paths.py``   — config-directory resolution.
- ``file.py``    — config.toml reading and validation.
- ``resolve.py`` — the precedence engine behind :func:`load_settings`.
- ``secrets.py`` + ``*_backend.py`` — optional secret-storage machinery:
  the backend dispatcher and the individual credential backends. Only
  consulted when the schema marks fields ``secret``; deletable as a unit
  when it marks none.
