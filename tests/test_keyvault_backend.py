"""Unit tests for the Azure Key Vault credential backend.

Nothing here reaches a real vault: the backend validates its configuration
before it builds a client, and the read-only hint is a module constant.

This module imports the Key Vault backend at module scope, so it is deleted
along with the backend when a project drops it.
